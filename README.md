# Predict the value of Used car

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Utilize AI for predictive pricing models, condition assessments via image recognition, sentiment analysis, mileage impact, regional pricing trends, enhanced vehicle history evaluations, supply-demand forecasting, and consumer preferences analysis.


## Background

The used car market is rapidly evolving due to various factors, including advancements in automotive technology, changes in economic conditions, and shifting consumer preferences. Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in supply chain disruptions, leading to delays in new car production and a surge in demand for used cars, causing their prices to rise significantly.

Currently, the value of used cars is determined by various elements such as mileage, vehicle condition, accident history, and the popularity of specific models. Utilizing AI technology for analysis provides a means to assess these values more accurately. For instance, predictive pricing models, condition assessments through image recognition, and consumer review analyses allow for more precise valuation of used cars.

In conclusion, the used car market is undergoing a transformation thanks to advancements in AI technology, which enables the provision of valuable insights and forecasts for both consumers and dealers.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1 : no tool to assess the used car value between seller and buyer
* problem 2 : traditional Information asymmetry and mis-selling market(Price inflation,Product defects, etc)


## How is it used?

By understanding the reasonable value of used cars and being able to overcome the imperfections in the used car market, the efficiency of the used car market is improved.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
!(https://www.grandviewresearch.com/static/img/research/us-used-car-market.png)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/static/img/research/us-used-car-market.png" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
